## Support

### Is support really 24/7?

Yes, but with a structure:

1. **AI support** handles common issues 24/7 (autonomous)
2. **AI manager** monitors and prioritizes incidents
3. **Human support** is available during business hours for critical issues

Most problems are resolved automatically without human intervention.

---

### What if I need urgent help at 3 AM?

The **AI support system** will handle it. If it's critical and can't be auto-resolved, it will be escalated to a human during the next business hours. We don't promise "instant human response 24/7" because that's not scalable or realistic.

---
