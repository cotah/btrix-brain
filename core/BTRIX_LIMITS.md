**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-02  
**Purpose:** Define clear boundaries and scope limitations

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines **what BTRIX does NOT do** to set clear expectations and avoid scope creep.

**Rule:** If it's listed here, BTRIX doesn't do it. No exceptions.

---

## 1. We Are NOT an Agency

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not** provide:
- ❌ Marketing campaigns
- ❌ Creative services
- ❌ Copywriting services
- ❌ Graphic design projects
- ❌ Video production projects
- ❌ Social media management (posting, engagement)
- ❌ Paid ads management (Google Ads, Facebook Ads)

### What we DO instead:

We build **systems** that help you automate operations. If you need creative work, hire an agency. If you need automation, use BTRIX.

---

## 2. We Are NOT a Consulting Firm

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not** provide:
- ❌ Strategic consulting
- ❌ Business advisory
- ❌ Market research
- ❌ Competitor analysis
- ❌ Business model design
- ❌ Organizational restructuring

### What we DO instead:

We build and operate **AI-powered systems**. We don't advise on strategy; we execute automation.

---

## 3. We Are NOT a SaaS Self-Service Tool

### What this means:

BTRIX is **not**:
- ❌ A DIY tool you configure yourself
- ❌ A drag-and-drop builder
- ❌ A self-service platform
- ❌ A no-code automation tool

### What we DO instead:

We **build, deploy, and operate** the system for you. You don't configure it; we do. You use it; we maintain it.

---

## 4. We Do NOT Provide 24/7 Human Support

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not** promise:
- ❌ Instant human response at 3 AM
- ❌ 24/7 phone support
- ❌ On-call human engineers at all hours

### What we DO instead:

We provide:
- ✅ **24/7 AI support** (autonomous)
- ✅ **AI incident manager** (prioritizes issues)
- ✅ **Human support during business hours** (for critical issues)

Most problems are auto-resolved. Critical issues are escalated to humans during business hours.

---

## 5. We Do NOT Replace Your Team

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not**:
- ❌ Replace your sales team
- ❌ Replace your marketing team
- ❌ Replace your customer support team
- ❌ Replace your managers

### What we DO instead:

We **augment** your team with automation and AI. Humans focus on strategy and high-value work. AI handles repetitive tasks.

---

## 6. We Do NOT Guarantee Results

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not** promise:
- ❌ "You'll get X leads per month"
- ❌ "Your revenue will increase by X%"
- ❌ "You'll close X deals"
- ❌ "Your costs will drop by X%"

### What we DO instead:

We build **reliable systems** that improve efficiency, reduce manual work, and provide operational intelligence. Results depend on your business, market, and execution.

---

## 7. We Do NOT Build Custom Software from Scratch

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not**:
- ❌ Build custom apps from scratch
- ❌ Develop proprietary software for you
- ❌ Create custom platforms
- ❌ Build mobile apps

### What we DO instead:

We integrate existing tools (WhatsApp, CRM, email, etc.) and add AI intelligence on top. If you need custom software, hire a development agency.

---

## 8. We Do NOT Provide Free Trials

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not** offer:
- ❌ Free trials
- ❌ Freemium plans
- ❌ "Try before you buy"

### What we DO instead:

We offer a **demo** to show how the system works. Setup requires real work (integration, configuration, testing), so there's no free trial.

---

## 9. We Do NOT Work with Everyone

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not** accept:
- ❌ Clients without a clear business model
- ❌ Clients expecting instant results
- ❌ Clients wanting "cheap automation"
- ❌ Clients needing consulting, not systems
- ❌ Clients in industries we can't serve effectively

### What we DO instead:

We **qualify carefully**. If BTRIX isn't a good fit, we'll tell you honestly during the demo. We don't force sales.

---

## 10. We Do NOT Customize Endlessly

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not**:
- ❌ Accept unlimited customization requests
- ❌ Build features on demand for individual clients
- ❌ Change core system behavior for one client

### What we DO instead:

- **Essential & Pro:** Limited customization (within scope)
- **Enterprise:** Custom configuration (within feasibility)

If your needs are too custom, we'll recommend building your own system or hiring a dev team.

---

## 11. We Do NOT Operate Outside Our Scope

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not**:
- ❌ Manage your inventory physically
- ❌ Handle your accounting
- ❌ File your taxes
- ❌ Manage your employees
- ❌ Run your operations manually

### What we DO instead:

We **automate** processes. We don't execute them manually. If you need manual work, hire staff.

---

## 12. We Do NOT Promise "AI Magic"

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not** claim:
- ❌ "AI will solve everything"
- ❌ "You'll never need humans again"
- ❌ "AI is perfect and never makes mistakes"

### What we DO instead:

We build **practical AI systems** that work reliably within defined scope. AI has limits. We're transparent about them.

---

## 13. We Do NOT Provide Legal, Financial, or Medical Advice

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not**:
- ❌ Provide legal advice
- ❌ Provide financial advice
- ❌ Provide medical advice
- ❌ Replace licensed professionals

### What we DO instead:

We automate **operational tasks** (lead capture, follow-ups, scheduling, etc.). For professional advice, consult licensed experts.

---

## 14. We Do NOT Operate in Gray Areas

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not**:
- ❌ Scrape data illegally
- ❌ Spam customers
- ❌ Violate GDPR or privacy laws
- ❌ Operate unethically

### What we DO instead:

We operate **ethically and legally**. We comply with GDPR, data protection laws, and platform policies (WhatsApp, etc.).

---

## 15. We Do NOT Accept Scope Creep

### What this means:

BTRIX does **not**:
- ❌ Add features mid-contract without approval
- ❌ Accept "just one more thing" requests endlessly
- ❌ Work outside the agreed scope

### What we DO instead:

We define **clear scope** at the start. If you need more, we discuss it, quote it, and add it formally. No informal scope creep.

---

- ✅ An **AI-powered operating system** for businesses
